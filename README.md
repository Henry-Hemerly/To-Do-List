## A to-do-list, using CSS?
Todays task is making a completely functional and interactive To-Do-List, using only CSS. A wise man (Jakob) once said: 

```If you need to learn a new language, make a to-do-list.```
We have provided you with the html file and you are supposed to be able to:

* Click items to mark them as done
* Click again to revert

We want you to:
* Use object oriented CSS
* Make sure it works the same way in both Firefox and Chrome (latest versions)
* Use proper naming conventions for elements and targeting them

_You are not allowed to:_
* Use JavaScript

Happy hacking!
