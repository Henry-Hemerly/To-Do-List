## A to-do-list, using CSS?
Todays task is making a functional and interactive To-Do-List, using only CSS.
A wise man (Jakob) once said:
```If you need to learn a new language, make a to-do-list.```

We have provided you with the HTML file and you are supposed to be able to:

* Click items to mark them as done
* Click again to revert

We want you to:
* Use object oriented CSS
* Make sure it works the same way in both Firefox and Chrome (latest versions)
* Use proper naming conventions for elements and targeting them

You are allowed to:
* Use SASS
* Add/rename/remove CSS classes and ID's
* Add/rephrase/remove text content and list items

_You are not allowed to:_
* Change the HTML structure
* Use JavaScript

Happy hacking!
